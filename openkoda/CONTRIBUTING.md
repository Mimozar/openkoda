# Contribution Guidelines

## Commit Message

The expected structure for git commit messages is:

```
Short commit subject

Commit message body.
This section explains how things worked before this commit, what has changed, and how things work now.

```

* Keep the commit subject text brief, 72 chars max
* Start subject with a capital letter
* No period at the end of subject line
* Use imperative statements in the subject line ("Fix", "Add", "Change" instead of "Fixed", "Added", "Changed")
* Add an empty line after the subject
* Add line breaks to the description section to make it more readable
